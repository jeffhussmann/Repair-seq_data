      Buttons to the right of the plot toggle different tools for interacting with the plot.
      Active tools are marked by a blue bar to the left of the button.
      For example, with the "Hover" tool active, hover the cursor over a point to learn which sgRNA it represents.

      Alternatively, with the "Box zoom" tool active, click and drag to zoom in on the selected rectangle.
      Click the "Zoom to data limits" button to set the zoom level on each axis to match the range of data for the current datasets.

  - title: 'Changing datasets' 
    text: |
      To change the screen or outcome category plotted on the x- or y-axis, click in the relevant menus, or use the up and down arrow keys once a menu is focused.  
      Highlighting of points will persist as the data source is changed, allowing comparison of phenotypes across conditions or outcomes.
