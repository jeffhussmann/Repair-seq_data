  - title: 'Activating tools'
    text: |
      Buttons to the right of the plot toggle different tools for interacting with the plot.
      Active tools are marked by a blue bar to the left of the button.
      For example, with the "Hover" tool active, hover the cursor over a point to learn which sgRNA it represents.

  - title: 'Selecting sgRNAs'
    text: |
      With the "Box Select" tool active, click and drag to select points in a region.
      Alternatively, type a query into the search field and hit enter to select matching sgRNAs.

  - title: 'Changing datasets' 
    text: |
      To change the screen or outcome category plotted, click in the relevant menus, or use the up and down arrow keys once a menu is focused.  
      Highlighting of sgRNAs will persist as the data source is changed, allowing comparison of phenotypes across conditions or outcomes.

  - title: 'Confidence intervals' 
    text: |
      The "Show confidence intervals" button toggles 95% binomial confidence intervals around each sgRNA's outcome frequency.

  - title: 'Significance filters' 
    text: |
      Genes that significantly increase or decrease the frequency of an outcome can be identified by approriately combining relevant p-values for each sgRNA targeting the gene.
      The "Filter to genes ..." buttons selects all sgRNAs whose gene-level p-value is below the selected significance threshold for the relevant effect direction.

  - title: 'Zooming in and out' 
    text: |
      With the "Wheel zoom" tool active and the cursor over the plot or either axis, scroll with the mouse wheel to zoom.
